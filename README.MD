# WeeGrad
An implementation of a neural network in C++
### Motivation
1. Becoming familiar with C++ (prior to this project I was familiar with C)
2. Learn about neural networks and how they are optimized 
3. Learn about the AVX
### Features
- Common activation layers (Sigmoid, ReLU, Tanh)
- Several AVX accelerated operations (Shur/Hadamard product, Vector addition)
### Warnings
- This was my first time implementing a neural network
- The implementation of gradient descent is hacky at best, broken at worst
